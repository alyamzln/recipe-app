CAT201 Project Food Recipe App (FlavourEcipe)

FlavourEcipe is a food recipe android app that we wish to build for users to easily search for
recipes under one platform. In addition, it is also a platform where users can share their own
recipes as well.
Our target audience would be:
1. People who have experience in cooking and are just searching for new recipe ideas.
2. People who are beginners and in need of guidance with cooking.
Main features:
1. User registration and login
2. Search functionality to find recipes
3. Manage food by category (Example: Beef, Chicken, Desserts, Pasta, etc.)
4. View recipe lists
